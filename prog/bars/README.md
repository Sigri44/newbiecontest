- create list of bars with id+coords, ex: 1 (3;5), 2 (0;4)...
- get first bar id, ex: 5
- get drinks list
- set bars drinks price
- for each drink
  - for each bar
    - get its distanceToBar N-1 and its price of drink N (absolute values)
  - define closestBar + cheapestBar
  - for each bar
    - set distanceRel(=closestBar.distance / barN.distanceToBar) and priceRel (relative values)
    - Px = distanceRel * priceRel
  - find bar with higher Px
